# Sales-Data-Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the Sales Data Analysis project repository. In this project, we perform data cleaning, data transformation and data analyis on a Sales Dataset using Python programming language and Jupyter Notebook as the IDE. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understand the project's objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.

## Dataset Description

The Dataset used in this project consists of comprehensive sales data including a wide range of information related to a retail company, such as order ID, product purchased, quantity ordered, price per unit, order date and purchase address.

## Project Objectives

* **Data Cleaning:** Conducting a full data cleaning process to organise the raw data into a structured format, including merging multiuple datasets into a single .csv file, removing Not-a-Number (NaN) rows, removing unrelated text, and relevant data type conversion of columns.   
* **Data Transformation:** Performing data transformation tasks, including standardizing data formats, and creating new features or columns using advanced techniques like lambda functions.
* **Data Analysis:** Executing thorough Data Analysis to produce insights into the target audience's purchase pattern, leading to a better and more effective Sales plan.
* **Data Visualisation:** Data storytelling through effective visualisations using python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn.

## Tools Used

* **Python** was used as the primary programming language to conduct data analysis.
* **Jupyter Notebook** was used as the Integrated Development Environment.
